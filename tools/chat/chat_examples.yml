- intent: confrontation
  examples:
    - No
    - No
    - Yeah, but this is foundation, I think.
    - No, for example, if we now talk with each other with open camera, maybe some problem af, some program can, I don't know, make sound like deep…
    - Yes, but it's your, how to say, it's your choice.
    - You can understand, but here, as I understand, the program can read your face.
    - Am, but I, I, I liked that topic a bit more, but again, I'm pretty open, hmhm (smiles).
    - Yeah, so yeah or we can look at what factors lead to successful emotional regulation. I don't know. Yeah…
    - Yeah, I think we have to narrow it down (overlaps).
    - (Continues) …. to two variables because I think when we also include, like, the intercultural aspect than it’s too much, yeah?
    - But…
    - But, it’s different topic, maybe.
    - Maybe not facial…
    - (interrupts) But this one has not…
    - A, a. just my one remark. Maybe, hm, I don't know, should we narrow down to facial? Maybe some application can, can record our body language, how to say, haha, not only, fa- face.
    - Or just, how, mmm, technology tools can facilitate students’ emotion regulation.
    - Okay but…
    - But I can't open. Right, just click home and can't see.
    - Yeah I can't see anything either.
    - I would prefer. I mean, I'm pretty flexible in general, but I would prefer if like if we had, if we figure it out one day of the week.
    - Is there another better day other than Wednesday? Because Wednesday might be a bit tight for me.
    - No, it's normal after 6.
    - Or Monday is also alright for me as well.
    - Yeah, but when you would like to write our article, we can write and edit at the same time.This is only possible in Google Docs.
    - Hmm I'm pretty sure it's okay in Teams, too.

- intent: elicitation
  examples:
    - Who can create google docs?
    - Let me just try it out. Have you discussed about the topic yet?
    - So we want to start talking about that first then we'll sort out the google document later?
    - The theoretical framework?
    - And maybe we can start thinking this…
    - (continues) … direction
    - So they used, am, this technology to help, am, like recognize emotions and how does it link to the regulation?
    - Ok, ok, so you provide the feedback about how the other people are, could be feeling.
    - It sounds quite new. Or is it? From which date is it? Which year is this study conducted?
    - How can I zoom?
    - Do you know what I mean?
    - Maybe that's something we can work from.
    - Oh, what is the title of the paper again?
    - So this is about conflict reg-, conflict resolution?
    - In the, in, in the cultural context or just general?
    - (Smiles) Yeah, I think I came across the top-, that that topic too, but I  didn't go in and read up on that… Aaa, yeah, so initially I… (Interrupts to check with P2) You're finished sharing your thoughts, hm?
    - Yeah, but this is, this is not about culture, yes? Yeah, this is just… (overlaps)
    - And this is, as I see, it's also it's computer supported, yes?
    - Technology…?
    - What does, what, what's her name, what’s the article? I tried to find.
    - it's so complicated (nodding yes) and not so much articles, yes?
    - Yeah, you mean like motivation (overlaps)…
    - Yeah, you mean like motivation and emotion?
    - Again, what’s my topic? Just the moment. Haha.
    - Maybe we, we can really just create the topic. Uh, can you repeat? H… How? How?
    - Or you mean my, my summary of this?
    - Ye-, ye-… No. I mean just one second ago., what you…
    - How facial (types)…
    - Implications?
    - Can you repeat please, Your idea? I tried to… understand.
    - K, could you please repeat again, again your ideas?
    - Uhm? Should we now switch to Google Doc? To make some notes…
    - As I understand, during two weeks, we have first module, and we need to answer this question, yes?
    - Yeah, do you have some problem, problems?
    - You can't enter your Google or your teams?
    - Does it work?
    - Ok, I think I got manage to get in now. OK, and then how do I link? OK, I think…. I managed (inaudible), ok. A just made one, right?
    - (continues) So, maybe you can open a document inside here?
    - Aaa, can you share a link or how I can join you?
    - Yeah, let's wait for, you can just create a document, maybe?
    - Why don't you open this inside your drive, and document in drive?
    - Does it work?
    - It should be, Yeah, it should now be linked with my Google Docs, right?
    - And if we just share the the link to the document?
    - So here is the link. I'll put it in the channel as well (pasting the link)…It doesn't work so well…where should I put (murmuring) So I posted in front. Are you able to get in?
    - All right. So the ideas that we had so far was?
    - It's pretty broad? But I think if we specify the technological tools specific, it will be hard to find articles as well, right?
    - I mean, maybe even, um, um, just these, um, video chat, like group chat in general? I don't know. I mean, I would imagine (interrupted)
    - So how can…collaboration, but our focus will be on the emotion part right?
    - through effective, emotional regulation...
    - Yeah, something more specific or something better, right?
    - So do you prefer like having weekly meetings at the same time? Or are you flexible in your timetable?
    - So like every week will be the same day and time that will be (interrupted)
    - This time or a little bit earlier?
    - Okay. If it's Thursday evening will be tiring for you?
    - Mhm. Thursday It's what date?
    - OK, do we have to check with the other, K? (laughter)
    - So we decided to meet once per week?
    - Yeah or should we put on Monday so the second meeting if we need in that we can put it on Thursday?
    - Yeah, OK. So Monday, what time will you all be good?
    - So I also have a class to four, and we can do maybe five or six?
    - So that would be four for me?
    - fifteen?
    - Okay so let's see what do we need?
    - So we put when we find suitable articles, should we put it in teams?
    - Shall we put it in like new conversation and then we attach it?
    - Or we just can't put in Google Doc?
    - Google doc. Which will be easier to see? Let me see. There we need a folder, right?
    - I'm not sharing screen. Like this is the folder and we just throw it in?
    - The articles, I will create the folder Articles (naming a folder) and then we put our articles inside?
    - But shall we put in Teams or?
    - Okay. Then we can just put it in teams, maybe we can put it under the files section?
    - I have one question. Why we decide to go to the Google Docs?
    - Because we have a note or Word in Teams.
    - Oh really?
    - Can I try?
    - Where do you put it? (inaudible)
    - Cool. OK, so we just add the the the dates is OK, so you can just ignore my…how do I change the name?
    - Maybe it's just today that maybe they have some maintenance or something?
    - So we'll meet on Monday and we'll decide on the task order. We have to settle all the tasks on Monday, right?

- intent: externalization 
  examples:
    - We just…waited for you
    - And trying to figure out the problems in Teams…um…
    - And share my screen. I have already put in our channel two documents. Sorry they are with my remarks
    - (smiling) No worries.
    - And this is general foundation of emotion regulation. I think we can start just reading this because it's very comprehensive overview of
    - Emotion
    - Yes about emotion, and emotion... Briefly, it's a part of our affect. And emotion, uh, this after created a model...a model that they have some situation, attention, appraisal and response regarding emotion. And we have five processes where we can regulate our emotions, situation selection, situation modification, attention deployment, cognitive change and modulation.
    - Yes, theoretical framework. Um, and just about emotion regulation and my second article. I start to thought about some tools, computer tool that can recognize and recognize yes face, facial emotion.
    - It must know your signal that you are angry or something. (smiles)
    - Some, I do not know…
    - Kind of…signals
    - For example, if during some lesson teachers can see some dashboards, or learning analytics graphic, which, for example, all classes are boring or not, only interest something like that.
    - Am, fo- four hours, four years ago.
    - 2017, as I see.
    - And with these, am, technology you could like, am, draw some patterns, for example? So, I mean everybody has a role in, in, in a group and then maybe the one who is the leader of the group maybe, has some specific emotion, I don't know. This could be quite interesting. If you follow this.
    - Profiling different people’s emotions and their roles.
    - So, stop sharing, this is my small preparation, ah (exhale).
    - I also liked the suggestion for, am, just the intercultural setting. I didn't really… I kind of just browsed, am, for some papers but, or articles, but I took a class last semester. It was kind of just one of these small seminar things about intercultural learning and I think there's definitely, aaa, it offers a wide variety. Am, but for example, like, am, there was one article I saw, that was about technology enhanced intercultural learning. But I I again I haven't really read through it, but I can maybe put it in the teams.
    - This one is Culture and the development of conflict resolution style by Spencer Kagan, here, I’ll... (looks like putting the article in teams)
    - Khm (Coughs). One second.
    - Sounds also interesting. Hmhm (smiles, everybody smiles pleasantly). Am, I also had a look on some papers and I came across a paper which title is The comparison between good and poor collaborators… (overlaps)
    - (Continues) and how they are different with their emotional regulation.
    - Am, that's what I found quite interesting, but I'm open for every topic. Hmhm (everybody smiles pleasantly).
    - Yeah, like I,I, I was looking at intercultural but I think I was trying to find intercultural and then CSCL and, aaa, emotional regulation. And I found that like it was a bit hard to find like articles particularly, like, on this 3 aspects. But maybe, if it's just intercultural and conflict resolution, maybe there are.
    - Yeah, so yeah, that was what I realized about the intercultural. I think it was a bit hard. I forgot to ask Essi just now about the article that they published on intercultural. But maybe I can ask her later.
    - Am, what I found, one that was interesting, was like, they had a few, there was involving scripting, so it was the use of scripting tools to facilitate emotional regulation.
    - So they got… Maybe I can show you what the article… (overlaps)
    - (Continues) So, they had a program that got students to, like,  they have to write something like a mini reflection. Let me share. Ok. The host has disabled screen sharing. (externalizing) I think you have to share the host with me or something.
    - Sorry, Sorry, yes, just a moment. Now you, co-host.
    - Ok, so yeah. So they had like, a system where like, students would fill in, like… Can I make it bigger (to herself)?
    - (inaudible) bigger. Yeah, so they all feel like, when I think about something like, working with my group, I am like, they have to feel their feelings like, and why and then like, how, how can they, like what better, what he they should do. (showing on a tool they need to feel out). So with this kind of (inaudible) they were analyzing how this is, this might help with their emotional regulation in the group. But it's I think it's more than just emotional regulation, it also involves the metacognition aspect. I thought this was quite interesting, they helped them…. Like, the script there helped to structure their thoughts and their emotions. Yeah (overlaps)…
    - It's a combination of how scripting can be used.
    - Yeah, to enhance regulation in, weather is it cognitive regulation or emotional regulation. I thought the system was quite interesting.
    - They had to analyze, like, write down their reflections. And then this, this, there were prompts to reflect on the collaboration.
    - Yeah, so this was one aspect. Uh, I think, another one that I happened to look at, was like… Uh, there were a few articles that look at motivate - , like what motivates students to regulate their emotions.
    - Yeah, but I let me see whether it works. No, ok… Maybe it will work. Oh, who is this man?
    - (Continues) … I’ll try to find. Mmm, wait, I forgot what I was… finish finding. This was on strategies and goals.
    - (Continues) Why they regulate, yeah. So, yeah, they were asked to describe how and why they, they try to regulate. Yeah, so what motivates them to regulate their emotions.
    - Or items of metacognition. So this few factors tend to interlink. OK, so we need to come, decide on, let’s see what was the thing that she had… We have to decide on specific topic.
    - Well, G’s, aaam, topic seemed quite specific, haha. I feel, like…
    - The, the article you shared, I mean, that seems…
    - I, you mean, these articles, but again, share my screen…
    - The AI, the use of facial recognition to facilitate emotional regulation.
    - I was saying that, am, so this one is how, am how facial recognition can help to facilitate emotional regulation.
    - (interrupts) I’ll write down (inaudible)…
    - Research question is always the hardest part.
    - (interrupts) Oh, yes, hold on, let me just, I am supposed to write down my password, which I forgot… (looks and types)
    - Hm, never mind I'll, I’ll do the linking later.
    - I was trying to link, but I, it's funny because I forgot my password to my Google, it’s ok.
    - Maybe…
    - I have open the document that…
    - Maybe I can also try it.
    - Yeah, there is one part that it says cloud, at plus cloud. It felt at the top right side.
    - Wait, first I need to sign in.
    - This one. At the, at cloud storage. And then you can link it to Google Drive.
    - OK, I think I have the same problem. I can’t remember my password, haha.
    - Password is always a problem to…
    - Oh no, I can't enter, ha.
    - Am, I can't enter my teams and my Google, I forgot my password.
    - Let's see, I can try it.
    - Actually, I have never used the Google Docs, hmhm.
    - That is why I ask you, but I used for example jamboard in Google, but not Google Docs, hah.
    - Aaam. Ok, add folder…
    - Uhm…
    - (Interrupts, talk in parallel) So…
    - The files, here.
    - And here.
    - Yeah, I don't. I'm trying to figure out how to do that. I mean, like when I open up this it's…(interrupted)
    - Yeah let's see…But then, okay, so then I would share this…(trying to create a document)
    - I'm a bit confused because I I haven't done this before. Um... (smiling)
    - Sorry, so then the folder in Teams
    - Okay hold on let me just try…
    - Okay…(figuring out) You'll see anything? On the…hmm that's odd. Doesn't show the Google Docs.
    - I shared the thing inside. Oh, you can only share folder but it doesn't show you the thing inside the folder…
    - OK, everyone here. OK, so let me just put the few ideas we had, OK? Keeping our task.
    - Yes, I want to copy paste from chat (interrupted)
    - (continued) the whole questions from Essi.
    - How technological or technology tool can facilitate students' emotion regulation.
    - So, we have a context. It's a student, students yes.
    - So this all we can talk about different aspects of the technology tools like in terms of facial recognition, expression, what AI gets, recognizers, express emotions, expressions.
    - (inaudible) and like scripting and facilitating, then maybe some other things.
    - Yeah I would imagine since COVID happened, maybe there's some stuff on that.
    - Communication media.
    - And how it can help collaboration work...
    - So topic is emotion regulation and technological tools combined together (laughing)
    - Question and problem, and aim. Or maybe we need to read some articles, find some literature and after that we can formulate.
    - Yeah, maybe now we can decide our schedule.
    - From next week I'm flexible because my internship finished this Friday.
    - Earlier would be nicer too. (laughing)
    - So in Finland time, so it's 3:00 o'clock in Germany.
    - Thursdays are pretty good and also Monday I have nothing.
    - On Thursday, Tuesday and Thursday I have a class till 6 from 2 till 6 in Finland time.
    - Thursday is 18th.
    - I think once a week schedule like one meeting, and if there's need, we can schedule another.
    - Any time for me.
    - Oh any time (laughing)
    - Okay. I have a class to two on Monday, but I think Essi mentioned that she's on her (interrupted)
    - teaching
    - timing, yeah, until is it four or five.
    - Monday…
    - Monday
    - Okay. I would check with the, yeah I think K should be alright on Monday 5 because we used to meet for the other for the readings on that timing.
    - And the goal, I guess, is to find literature. And then also try to read or just skim through it.
    - And maybe maybe we need to make some, I don't know, notes about article.
    - Some findings or something interesting and (interrupted)
    - When you find something, if we if you could notify everybody else, I mean that's kind of (interrupted)
    - It's confusing a little bit.
    - I would prefer to stick with Teams.
    - To write our article. That's why we decided to go to Google Docs.
    - We can try.
    - I can try whether it works correctly
    - If I do new Word document like meeting…
    - OK, so you're doing it now, right? OK, I'll let you do it.
    - You should be able to now see just an empty document. And here we can…
    - Ah, in files. Maybe I should rename it to today's date too 10 November meeting.
    - I have already put a copy information from Google Docs.
    - OK, because I didn't know this, there is a real time sync in Teams.
    - OK, so we can put our notes here in
    - OK, I will fix my problem with teams and then I will join you
    - It could be because this happened kind of to me earlier today for some reason I logged out of the Oulu teams, my Oulu teams account and then when I opened up teams it was like crashing and it wouldn't connect or something. I don't know if it was similar to what you experienced.
    - It should hopefully work in a bit.
    - Thank you.
    - Have a good evening
    - Bye

- intent: integration 
  examples:
    - Okay, so I think we had a couple of ideas, right?
    - Yeah, this was also a part of the readings and the videos.
    - I guess, like, Teams already kind of has the beginning of that, because, like, now in a class you can, like, click on the little emoji thing, or like yeah, even here in zoom, like, I can do a reaction like.
    - And the roles, connected to their roles, yeah.
    - Hm, (laughs) I think all, all topics focus on emotion regulation, because what we can do with emotion, just regulate, hmhm (laughs).
    - Yeah, I think there's, there's no… There is very little article that are  specifically on, like, emotions in CSCL. They tend to mix it a bit.
    - (ovelaps inaudible) regulation.
    - And also, like, self-regulation, yeah.
    - Or maybe we can, am…
    - (continues) include this one… Like the emotional regulation tool, we can include it in our article when we describe how we can….
    - (continues) make this visible, these emotional, am, reactions visible. Then we could include it with this tool maybe, as in suggestion…
    - Yeah, yeah sure. So, when we describe something about, like, collaboration and emotional regulation in, yeah and collaboration, like H said, then we can put a section in the article, like, how we can observe these emotional re- or these emotional reactions and then we could suggest this tool that you presented to us.
    - Just, just my idea to put these ideas together.
    - Okay, so we can just use this. Yeah, OK, we'll learn to use Teams and then everything can be all in one place.

- intent: quick_consensus
  examples:
    - Alright!
    - I can create, I'm trying to explore it they can link it from Teams beacause there's is a cloud storage so I can add a folder.
    - Mhm
    - Ohh sorry! (laughing) Okay.
    - Sounds great.
    - Yeah.
    - Yes. I can start for example.
    - Okay sure!
    - Yes yes yes! Lecturer I think she took this information and incorporated in their article.
    - Yeah
    - Mhm.
    - Ok.
    - Mmm.
    - Mmm (overlaps)…
    - Yes, yes you're happy now or not, your friend…
    - (Overlaps) Haha, I am happy
    - Ok,
    - Yes, maybe it's a good for teachers as well.
    - Ok.
    - Yeah, yeah.
    - Yeah, yeah, exactly. (overlaps)
    - Mmm.
    - Ok.
    - Yeah, I think that program can detect if this person is really happy, unhappy, sad, suprised.
    - Mhm
    - OK.
    - Oh, alright.
    - Mm.
    - Mhm.
    - Ok.
    - Mhm.
    - Khm. (coughs)
    - Yes, I…
    - Mhm, ok.
    - Definitely, yeah.
    - Mhm.
    - Yeah.
    - Am, In the cultural context, I believe, I'll, I'll upload this part.
    - Okay, interesting.
    - Ah, ok.
    - Aaa.
    - Yeah, it was just a quick note. (smiles as well)
    - Yeah, yeah, this is not cultural, yeah, this is just, how scripting can help to facilitate emotional regulation.   But this is one. Yeah, then the intercultural like communication is also another aspect, we can look at. Or we can also look at…what was this?
    - Yes.
    - Yes, yes, this is so, yes, this involves a, this is a cross towards scripting.
    - Haha, I copied the link, but I forgot to copy the, the, the title…
    - (Interrupts) Mhm.
    - Mhm (interrupts).
    - Yeah (small break). Yeah, yeah, so yeah.
    - Yeah.
    - Yes, yeah, so we have to, yeah.
    - (overlaps) emotional regulation, yes, yes, I like this.
    - Ah, okay.
    - Mmm.
    - Mhm (nodding). Yes, mmm…
    - Mhm. Hm…
    - Yeah, it is (smiles).
    - Haha.
    - Aaa, yeah, and after these two weeks we move to the other part.
    - Am, yeah.
    - Yeah, you can try linking.
    - Oh yeah, haha.
    - Haha, let's see.
    - Haha.
    - Haha.
    - Oh, ok, haha.
    - Ah, OK. N...
    - Yeah. OK, so I will, I’ll link my then.
    - OK… (interrupted)
    - Yeah, one second.
    - So, it's on teams. You just have to go to teams, go to our File, go to Files.
    - Mhm.
    - Files, yes.
    - Aaa, cool.
    - Hold home, yes, as I see it.
    - Yeah. So anything you put inside home will be in here.
    - Yeah maybe
    - Yeah.
    - OK, that works as well.
    - Yeah, I think that would be easier.
    - Maybe that's easier.
    - Yes
    - Ohh okay (laughter)
    - Okay.
    - Yeah
    - Okay, communciation…
    - Yeah maybe
    - Okay. This is specific topic…(murmuring)
    - Yeah(laughing)
    - Okay
    - Yes
    - Yeah that's a good idea.
    - Okay
    - That would be nice.
    - For me, Wednesdays are really, really nice. I only have one class in the morning, so yeah.
    - Yeah (smiling)
    - Yeah for me as well. I think I have class till 4:00 o'clock and afterwards I'm free.
    - Cool
    - That would be even better for me.
    - Okay
    - OK. Yeah, I'm good with Thursday or Monday as well.
    - Yes yes
    - Monday also works for me.
    - And for me.
    - For me too.
    - Yes, maybe first meeting should be on Monday.
    - Yeah, I I'm completely free on Monday, so.
    - Yeah. OK. Maybe if Monday five, so maybe write down this. Thank you.
    - Yes yes it's Finnish time
    - Okay yes Finnish time. ...
